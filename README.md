# Robot-Cafe-in-LA

# Project Description
I have decided to open a small cafe in Los Angeles. My cafe is quite unique, as you "employ" robots as waiters or waitresses. The project is promising, but requires a lot of capital. 
Therefore, I and my partners decide to appeal to investors. They are attracted by the current market conditions-but can you sustain success when the robot's appeal fades?
Since I am an analytics expert, the partners ask me to prepare some market research. I have open-source data on the types of dining establishments in LA.

# Instructions for Completing the Project
1. Downloading data and preparing it for analysis
2. Download the data related to the different types of eateries in LA.
3. Ensure that the data type for each column is correct and there are no missing or duplicate values. Pre-process the data if necessary.

# Analyze the data
1. Examine the proportions of the different types of businesses. Make a graph.
2. Examine the proportion of franchise-based and non-franchise-based businesses. Make a graph.
3. Which types of businesses are usually franchise-based businesses?
4. Which are the characteristics of franchise-based businesses: having many places with few seats or having a few places with many seats?
5. Determine the average number of seats for each type of business. On average, which type of business has the most seats?
6. Move the street name data from the address column to a separate column.
7. Create a graph showing the top ten street names by number of businesses (eateries).
8. Find the number of streets that have only one business (eatery).
9. For streets with many businesses (eateries), look at the distribution of the number of seats. What trends can you observe?
10. Draw general conclusions and make recommendations on the types of businesses and the number of seats. Comment on opportunities for franchise-based business development.
